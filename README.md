Scripts written by me during my time at The Devhouse Agency

During my time at the company, I had a Github account linked to an email provided by my employer. After my time there, I lost access to my account and  2 years of commit history. 
This explains the lack of logged work on this account. All activity from this account should reflect my work post-Devhouse.
